# qpcpp650

This repo is a copy from qpcpp 6.5.0, current version is 7.2.2 at this time.

I'm doing some testing, adding log and debug info, check in code here, so I'll know what changes I've made.
The examples were generated by QM 4.5.0, it said NOT EDIT MANUALLY, but I'm still going to modify them, just for researching.
